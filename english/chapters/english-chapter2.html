What does Mandela mean when he says he is "simply the sum of all those African patriots" who had gone before him?</span ><br><strong >Answer :</strong ><br>By saying that he is "simply the sum of all those African patriots", Mandela offers his tribute to all the people who had sacrificed their lives in favour of the struggle for freedom. He says that he shall always remain grateful and thankful to those who had gone before him because those freedom fighters had paved the path of cooperation and unity for him. Therefore, Mandela felt that when he came to power, he would bring equality among his people with their support and cooperation.<br><span style="color:#0600d1;font-weight:bold;font-size:0.95rem"><br>16. Would you agree that the "depths of oppression" create "heights of character "? How does Mandela illustrate this? Can you add your own examples to the argument?</span ><br><strong >Answer :</strong ><br>Yes, I agree with the statement that "depths of oppression" do create 'heights of character". Nelson Mandela illustrates this by citing examples of great heroes of South Africa such as Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Chief Luthulis, Yusuf Dadoos, Bram Fischers, and Robert Sobukwes, among others who inspired others by sacrificing their lives in the long struggle for freedom.<br>In India's pre-Independence era, there was a galaxy of great leaders who didn't bend their knees to the oppression of British rule, such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Chandra Shekhar Ajad, Bhagat Singh and many more. Nelson Mandela seems to be absolutely right, if we compare them with the quality of political leaders that came later. It seems that great leaders are created in the crucible of oppression and suffering.<br><span style="color:#0600d1;font-weight:bold;font-size:0.95rem"><br>17. How did Mandela's understanding of freedom change with age an experience?</span ><br><strong >Answer :</strong ><br>With age and rich experience, Mandela understood the essence of freedom in everyone's life. As a young boy, he always thought that he was born free and could do anything that he wanted. He strongly believed that as long as he obeyed his father and abided by the customs of his tribe, he was free in every possible way.<br>However, as he grew older, he started feeling that freedom was required to raise a family and to earn a livelihood, and this started dominating his thoughts and views. In due course of time, he realised that he was selfish and was leading an illusionary life during his boyhood. He slowly understood that it was not his freedom alone that was being curtailed, but the freedom of all Black people was retrenched. Mandela understood that his people were being deprived and discriminated and this led him to develop a hunger for the freedom of his people.<br><span style="color:#0600d1;font-weight:bold;font-size:0.95rem"><br>18. How did Mandela's 'hunger for freedom' change his life?</span ><br><strong >Answer :</strong ><br>During his youth, Mandela realised that it was not just his freedom alone that was being curtailed, but the freedom of all Black people. The hunger for his own freedom became the hunger for freedom for all his fellow brothers and sisters. In the process, this changed the fearful man into a bold rebel. Mandela sacrificed the comforts of a settled family life to fight for the freedom of his countrymen. He joined the African National Congress, and this transformed him from a frightened young man into a fearless person who fought against racial prejudice and colour discrimination.
