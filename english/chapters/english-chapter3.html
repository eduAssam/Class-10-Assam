He thought that his wings would not support him while he attempted to make his first flight.<br>Yes, it's quite natural and obvious that doing something for the first time can be frightening and a bit challenging. Certainly, all birds must be afraid to make their first flight.<br>Likewise, a human baby is also afraid and finds it very challenging when it takes its first steps or when it learns to crawl or walk on its own without any support.

                 <div class="preview-answer preview-full-width"><strong >Answer  :</strong ><br>The young seagull failed to muster up the courage to make his first flight. His family constantly upbraided him to take the plunge, but to no avail.<br>They let him stay on the ledge until he was ready to take the plunge. He was left there for more than twenty-four hours and was very hungry by then. Due to this hunger, he was ultimately compelled to fly. Furthermore, his hunger intensified when he saw his mother tearing at a piece of fish that was lying at her feet. He cried desperately, begging her to get some food for him. Seeing this, when his mother came towards him with food in her beak, the little seagull screamed with joy and anticipation. However, she stopped midway, and the young seagull wondered why she did not come closer to him. Maddened by hunger, he dived at the food in his mother's beak. At that moment, he fell outwards and downwards into the great expanse of sea beneath the cliff. He was terrified, and his heart stood still.<br>But soon enough, he felt his wings spread outwards, and he realized that he could fly like others. Therefore, his hunger overpowered his fear, and he finally made his first flight joyfully.

                 <div class="preview-answer preview-full-width"><strong >Answer  :</strong ><br>The young seagull's parents were constantly beckoning him and he tried everything to make his first flight. However, he was very reluctant to take the plunge due to his fear of falling down from the cliff. He looked at his brothers and sister, who flew away, but he was hesitant to make any effort. Due to this reason, his whole family had left him alone on his ledge and threatened and persuaded him to fly, but all efforts went in vain.

                 <div class="preview-answer preview-full-width"><strong >Answer  :</strong ><br>Yes, I had a similar experience while trying to learn how to ride a bicycle when I was in the fourth standard. Initially, I found it difficult to balance myself and fell down often, which developed a fear of cycling in me. Unable to overcome the fear, I gave up cycling, but my parents would always cajole me to try and practise cycling whenever I get time. My father would hold the bicycle from behind to help me balance myself, but whenever he took off his hand, I would lose balance and fall down. Gradually as I practised every day, my cycling skills improved, and I could ride it without my father's support from behind. This also developed my confidence to a great extent. Thus, I overcame my fear of cycling and started riding the cycle confidently when I practised it daily. Now, I use a cycle while going to and coming from school every day.

                 <div class="preview-answer preview-full-width"><strong >Answer  :</strong ><br>It is natural for everyone to face some problems initially while trying to learn or pick up a new skill. Many a time, due to the fear of failure, we are reluctant to perform a particular task or attempt something new. In the case of the seagull, his parents constantly cajoled him into flying. Similarly, when I was learning to ride a cycle for the first time, my father always persuaded me to learn to cycle. Hence, at that stage, it was important for me to overcome my fear and learn cycling for my own good.<br>Yes, my success was assured because if one is focused and determined to achieve something, then success is guaranteed. Moreover, we are all aware of the famous adage, "Practice makes a man perfect".

On the way, his plane was engulfed in a huge storm of black clouds. So, he decided to fly straight into the storm as he did not want to miss the opportunity to meet his family for a good English breakfast. Thus, he took the risk of flying through the storm even when the visibility was almost nil.

He could not see anything outside the plane as it was engulfed by completely black storm clouds.<br>When he looked at the compass and other instruments, they had stopped functioning due to the turbulent weather. It was a fearsome and frightening experience for the pilot. The fuel tank of his plane was also almost empty and he could not fly more than ten minutes in it. Suddenly out of nowhere, he saw another black aeroplane with no lights on its wings appear by his side, and the pilot of that plane beckoned him to follow. The narrator obediently followed the other black plane that had no light. He followed the strange black aeroplane without any choice through the storm and soon landed on the runway safely.

                 <div class="preview-answer preview-full-width"><strong >Answer  :</strong ><br>There is no definite explanation for the appearance of the unknown pilot who helped the narrator. We can assume that it was probably the narrator himself who overcame his fear in the midst of a storm as no other plane was visible in the radar except the narrator's Dakota DS 088. In that frightening situation, the pilot might have fantasized that someone had come to his help. However, he was a good pilot, brave enough to fly through a dense and turbulent storm and land on the runway safely.
